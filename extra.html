                                    Seedly is a native mobile application that was developed for both iOS and Android systems. I designed Seedly to be a plant app meant for anyone who has a passion for gardening, or wishes to take better care of their plants. These individuals need an outlet to gain knowledge and engage in better plant habits to allow them to have the garden of their dreams.

                                    This project allowed me to vastly step outside my comfort zone and become familiar with both Apple Design Resources and Material Design. As using only iOS systems my entire life, this was exceptionally challenging but thoroughly exposed me to become just as familiar with Android systems also. I would say this project challenged me the most and showcases my design quality to the highest level.

                                    Cookly is a responsive web application that was designed for anyone with a passion for cooking. The app was designed to enhance the overall experience in the kitchen and allow aspirational home cooks to feel at ease knowing they have their very own chef assistant and friend.
