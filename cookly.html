                    Cookly is a responsive web application that was designed for anyone with a passion for
                    cooking. The app was designed to enhance the overall experience in the kitchen and allow
                    aspirational home cooks to feel at ease knowing they have their very own chef assistant and
                    friend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this project, I thoroughly focused on user testing and catering to the needs of my
                    participants. This project allowed me to lose my designer biasism and design through the
                    lens of my users and focusing on their experience.

                        <p>Numerous recipe apps are not beginner friendly to new cooks, making them feel unmotivated to learn and improve their ability. Furthermore, many of these apps are not inclusive to various dietary preferences which leads individuals to feel frustrated or left out because they cannot find meals that cater to their eating lifestyle. </p>

                    <p>These paper prototypes and mid-fidelity wireframes were developed to test early concepts quickly and get clear feedback from real users. I focused on creating an intuitive layout that makes discovering and saving recipes simple and engaging.</p>
                    <p>Key features like search, recipe categories, and saving to personal cookbooks were refined through wireframes to ensure the design felt approachable for both beginners and experienced cooks alike.</p>
                    <p>This process helped validate core interactions before moving to high-fidelity screens, keeping the user experience clean, practical, and fun to use in the kitchen.</p>

                    <li>Users wanted to see the image first as opposed to other information</li>

                    <li>Bookmark/Share/Rating features were moved to allow better space and focus on the main

                <p>This project thoroughly tested me as a designer and allowed me to lose my designer biasism and design strictly according to my users needs and wants. I've always been used to doing things best the way I see fit my entire life, especially when it came to being creative and designing anything at my hand. By being user-centered, this allowed me to enhance the overall experience of my audience and gain the first crucial step and understanding on what it takes to be an excellent UI designer.</p>
                <p>Conducting user interviews and user testing allowed me to exceptionally excel at this skill, that now comes by nature.</p>
